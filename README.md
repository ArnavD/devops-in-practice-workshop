# DevOps in Practice Hands-On Workshop

This project is a fork of the [Spring Petclinic](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic)
application. It is used as the sample application for the workshop "DevOps in Practice".

## Pre-Workshop Setup

Follow the [instructions to setup your laptop](./SETUP.md) **prior to attending the workshop**.

## Workshop Instructions

The workshop is divided into several steps, which build on top of each other. Instructions for
each exercise can be found under the [`instructions`](./instructions) folder. A sample solution for each step
can be found on a separate branch `step-N`, where `N` corresponds to the next step number (e.g.
`step-1`, `step-2`, ...)

I recommend you fork this project before cloning to your machine, to allow you to
make changes, commit them, and push to your own repository.
